The Real-Time Messaging Framework by name PulseStream is a lightweight and efficient solution that allows developers to receive real-time messages from a database without overloading the server with unnecessary requests. This framework is designed to provide a seamless experience for developers who need real-time updates from their databases while minimizing the server load.infact it does not request anything from the server unless there is a change of state from that particular table

# Features
## Efficient Real-Time Message Delivery:
The framework leverages intelligent techniques to deliver real-time messages to connected clients based on changes in the database, ensuring that updates are sent only when necessary.

## Minimal Server Load:
By incorporating caching mechanisms and smart querying, the framework avoids excessive requests to the database, reducing server load and optimizing resource utilization.

## Scalable and Lightweight:
The framework is designed with scalability in mind, allowing it to handle a large number of simultaneous connections without sacrificing performance. Its lightweight nature ensures minimal overhead and efficient processing.

## Easy Integration: 
With a user-friendly API, the framework enables developers to easily integrate real-time messaging capabilities into their applications. Developers can specify their criteria for receiving updates, such as specific database tables or fields.

## Community-Driven Collaboration:
We encourage developers to join our research program, provide feedback, contribute to the project, and suggest improvements. Together, we can create a more effective and optimized real-time messaging framework.
