#  ```PulseStream``` To-Do List for User Authentication:
![Framework Logo](logos/pulsestream-high-resolution-logo-color-on-transparent-background.png)

## User Registration API(Heavy weight):

Create a registration form with fields for username, email, and password.
Validate user input and ensure unique usernames and valid email addresses.
Hash and salt the password before storing it securely in the database.
Implement server-side validation and error handling for registration.

## User Login API(Heavy weight):

Create a login form with fields for username/email and password.
Verify the provided credentials against the stored user data in the database.
Generate an authentication token or session for the user upon successful login.
Implement server-side validation and error handling for login.

## Authentication Middleware:

Develop a middleware or authentication layer to protect routes and APIs.
Verify the user's authentication token or session before allowing access to protected resources.
Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page or return an appropriate error response.

## Token-Based Authentication:

Implement token-based authentication using a library like JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Generate a JWT upon successful login and include it in the response to the client.
Verify the JWT in subsequent requests using a secret key and extract user information from it.

## Secure Password Storage:

Hash and salt the user's password before storing it in the database.
Use a secure and industry-standard hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2.
Apply proper salting techniques to protect against rainbow table attacks.

## Password Reset Functionality:

Provide a "Forgot Password" feature allowing users to reset their passwords.
Generate a unique password reset token and send it to the user's registered email address.
Create a password reset form where users can enter their new password and the reset token.
Verify the reset token and update the password in the database.

## User Profile Management:

Implement a user profile page where users can view and update their profile information.
Allow users to change their password, update their email address, or upload a profile picture.
Validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious actions or data corruption.

## User Roles and Permissions:

Define different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and associated permissions.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain features or resources.
Assign roles to users during registration or through an admin interface.

## Secure Sessions and CSRF Protection:

Implement secure session handling mechanisms to manage user sessions.
Store session data securely and use proper session management techniques.
Implement CSRF protection by generating and validating CSRF tokens for sensitive operations.

##  with Push Notifications:

Associate user accounts with device tokens or registration IDs from your push notification system.
Use the user's authentication information to send personalized notifications.
Implement appropriate logic to handle user preferences, notification settings, and opt-in/opt-out options.
Remember to test the authentication features thoroughly, including positive and negative scenarios, to ensure the security and reliability of your implementation. Regularly update and patch your framework and libraries to address any security vulnerabilities that may arise.

# ToDo for real time messaging without sockets or server overloading

## Client-Side:

Create a user interface for chat messaging, liking, commenting, and other features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to send HTTP requests to the server without page reloads.
Implement JavaScript functions to handle user interactions, capture user input, and update the UI dynamically.

## Server-Side:

Set up server-side scripts using PHP to handle AJAX requests and process the required actions.
Create PHP endpoints/routes for sending messages, liking, commenting, and other desired features.
Use a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve chat messages, likes, comments, and other relevant data.


## Real-Time Updates with Long Polling:

Implement long polling on the client side using JavaScript to continuously check for new updates from the server.
When a user sends a message or performs an action, send an AJAX request to the server to process the action and update the relevant data in the database.
On the server side, have a PHP script that listens for new updates and responds only when there is new data available.
If there are no updates, keep the connection open for a specified duration (e.g., a few seconds) before responding to the client. This delay prevents excessive polling and reduces server load.

## Notification System:

Implement a notification system to inform users about new messages, likes, comments, or any other relevant activities.
Use AJAX requests to periodically check for new notifications on the server side.
When new notifications are available, send the data back to the client and update the UI to display the notifications.

## Data Synchronization:

To keep the chat messages and other features synchronized across multiple clients, implement appropriate logic on the server side.
When a user sends a message, update the database and notify other relevant users about the new message.
Use long polling or periodic AJAX requests to check for updates and fetch the latest data from the server.

## Security Considerations:

```Implement proper input validation and sanitization on both the client and server sides to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL injection.
Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access and perform actions on the chat and other features.
Protect sensitive data by using secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) and encrypting sensitive information when storing it in the database.```
